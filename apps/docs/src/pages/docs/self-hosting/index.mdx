# Self-hosting

This is a simple guide how to get started with OpenPanel on your own VPS.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- VPS of any kind (only tested on Ubuntu 24.04)
- [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com) account (they have a free tier)

<Steps>


### Clone

Clone the repository to your VPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Openpanel-dev/openpanel.git
```

### Run the setup script

The setup script will do 3 things

1. Install node (if you accept)
2. Install docker (if you accept)
3. Execute a node script that will ask some questions about your setup
4. After this is done you'll need to point a webhook inside Clerk (https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/clerk)

> Setup takes 5-10 minutes depending on your VPS. It'll build all the docker images.

```bash
cd openpanel/self-hosting
./setup
```

### Start ðŸš€

Run the `./start` script located inside the self-hosting folder

```bash
./start
```
</Steps>

## Clerk.com

<Callout>
Some might wonder why we use Clerk.com for authentication. The main reason for this is that Clerk have great support for iOS and Android apps. We're in the process of building an iOS app and we want to have a seamless experience for our users. 

**next-auth** is great, but lacks good support for mobile apps.
</Callout>

You'll need to create an account at [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and create a new project. You'll need the 3 keys that Clerk provides you with.

- **Publishable key** `pk_live_xxx`
- **Secret key** `sk_live_xxx`
- **Signing secret** `"whsec_xxx"`

### Webhooks

You'll also need to add a webhook to your domain. We listen on some events from Clerk to keep our database in sync.

#### URL

- **Path**: `/api/webhook/clerk`
- **Example**: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook/clerk`

#### Events we listen to

- `organizationMembership.created`
- `user.created`
- `organizationMembership.deleted`
- `user.updated`
- `user.deleted`

## Good to know

When self-hosting you'll need to provide your api url when initializing the SDK.

The path should be `/api` and the domain should be your domain.

```html filename="index.html" {4}
<script>
  window.op = window.op||function(...args){(window.op.q=window.op.q||[]).push(args);};
  window.op('init', {
    apiUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/api',
    clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    trackScreenViews: true,
    trackOutgoingLinks: true,
    trackAttributes: true,
  });
</script>
<script src="https://openpanel.dev/op1.js" defer async></script>
```

```js filename="op.ts" {4}
import { OpenPanel } from '@openpanel/sdk';

const op = new OpenPanel({
  apiUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/api',
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  trackScreenViews: true,
  trackOutgoingLinks: true,
  trackAttributes: true,
});
```
