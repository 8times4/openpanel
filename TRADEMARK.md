## Acceptable Uses

You are permitted to use the Openpanel name in the following situations, provided it is done truthfully and accurately:

- To refer to Openpanel and its products and services in news articles and other content without alteration.
- To discuss Openpanel and its products in a fair and honest manner that does not imply sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with Openpanel.
- To refer to and/or link to the products and services hosted on Openpanelâ€™s servers and website.
- To indicate if your product, service, or solution integrates, is interoperable, or compatible with Openpanel, as long as it does not create confusion about the origin of your offering.
- You may use our word marks as part of a public subdomain solely for serving as the URL for your self-managed Openpanel instance (e.g., openpanel.companyname.com).

## Prohibited Uses

Unless you have explicit written permission from Openpanel or your use falls under the acceptable uses mentioned above, the use of Openpanel trademarks is strictly prohibited. Here are examples of prohibited uses that may be considered for permission upon request:

- Use of Openpanel trademarks in connection with a public website offering Openpanel software for installation and use on a server (instead of directing users to the official Openpanel site).
- Use of Openpanel trademarks in connection with versions of Openpanel products made publicly available or offered in the cloud by a managed service provider, resale, or other commercial basis.
- Use of Openpanel trademarks in connection with bundling Openpanel products with other software.

In these cases:

- Adherence to the terms of the open-source license for Openpanel software products and code is mandatory.
- Removal of all Openpanel logos is required, with the adoption of your own branding to clearly signify no affiliation with or endorsement by Openpanel.
- Avoidance of using any Openpanel trademark in connection with the user-facing name, branding, or marketing materials of your project.
- Usage of word marks, but not logos, in truthful statements describing the relationship between your software and Openpanel is allowed. For instance, "this software is derived from the source code of the Openpanel software," along with a disclaimer that your project is not officially associated with Openpanel or its products.

Openpanel reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to (i) terminate, revoke, modify, or change permission to use the trademarks at any time and; (ii) object to any use or misuse of the trademarks globally. Any changes to these guidelines are effective immediately upon posting, and your continued use of the trademarks following revised guidelines signifies your acceptance of such revisions.
